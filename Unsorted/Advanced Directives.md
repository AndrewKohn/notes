# Advanced Directives

---
## Objectives :
- Identify the most common types of advance directives and find out if a person has made them.
- Explain how advance directives can improve quality of life, even at the end of life.

---

Advanced directives are legal documents with instructions that apply if an adult is unable to make decisions about their own healthcare.

They are meant to ensure that a person's values related to dying, quality of life, and other relevant matters are honored.

***Informed Consent*** occurs when a healthcare provider educates the patient about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of a given procedure or intervention.  A person can only give informed consent if they understand their diagnosis.

The ***National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization*** website keeps an updated list of each state's advance directives and laws.

### Common types of Advance Directives

#### Living Wills :
- Contain instructions about how a person wants to be cared for in the event that they have a condition that is likely to be life-ending or are in a state of unconsciousness from which they are unlikely to recover.
- The focus of a living will is on treatments that are used to prolong and sustain life, such as:
	- CPR
	- Ventilators
	- Tube Feeding
	- Dialysis
- It must have been signed when the person was able to understand both its contents and how the advance directive could be used.
- A person may cancel or change a living will at any time, as long as they are able to understand what they are doing.
- Elements that may differ from state-to-state include:
	- Number of witnesses
	- Who can be a witness
	- Notarization
	- Electronic records
	- Regular renewal
