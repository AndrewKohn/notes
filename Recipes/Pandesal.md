1. Heat oven to 180°F degrees.  Turn off oven when it reaches temperature, as we want the heat to help with the dough rise later.
2. Create the yeast mix and let it start activating for roughly 10 minutes.  It should be forming bubbles.
3. If yeast mix is ready, add the egg mix and stir together.  Add the melted butter last.
