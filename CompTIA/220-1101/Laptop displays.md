# Laptop displays

### Portable LCD

- LCD - Liquid Crystal Display
	- Light shines thru liquid crystals

Advantages:
- Lightweight
- Relatively low power
- relatively inexpensive

Disadvantages:
- Black levels can be a challenge (getting a true black may be difficult to obtain)
- Requires separate backlight


### LCD Technologies

- TN (twisted nematic) LCD
	- The original lcd tech.
	- fast response time (ie gaming, 1ms, etc...)
	- poor viewing angles -- color shifts
- IPS (In Plane Switching) LCD
	- Excellent color representation
	- More expensive to produce than TN
- VA (Vertical Alignment) LCD
	- A good compromise between TN & IPS
	- Good color representation
	- Slower response times than TN


### OLED

- OLED - Organic Light Emitting Diode
	- Organic compound emits light when receiving an electric current
- Thinner & lighter
- No backlight
- Tablets, phones, smart watches

### Wi-Fi Antennas

- multiple antennas
	- Wifi main and aux
	- bluetooth
- Antenna wires wrap around the laptop screen


### Webcam

- Video Capture
- Usually includes both audio and visual
- specialized drivers and software


### Fluorescent vs LED backlighting

- CCFL - Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp
	- Higher voltage and power needed
	- Added thickness to display
	- No longer a common backlight -- older laptops will use these.
- LED-backlit LCD Display
	- Backlight is LEDs instead of florescent
	- LEDs around the edge of the screen
	- An array of LEDs behind the screen
	- Latest laptops are LED-backlit


### Backlight and Inverter

- LCD displays need a backlight
- Some laptops have inverters -- turn DC into AC
- May need to replace lcd inverter or the display itself


### Digitizer

- Use a pen-like device as input
	- stylus
	- useful for graphical input
- common on laptops/tablets


### Touchscreen

- merge laptop and tablet input -- no keyboard required
- digitizer responds to touch
