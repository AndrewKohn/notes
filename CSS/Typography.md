# Typography

#### Serif vs Sans-Serif
- SERIF:
	- Serif typeface has the tails within the characters.
	- Creates a traditional/classic look and feel.
	- Conveys trustworthiness
	- Good for long text
- SANS-SERIF:
	- Modern look and feel
	- Clean and simple
	- Easier to choose for a beginner designer

Typography rules:
1. Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe

2. It's okay to use just one typeface per page!  If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
3. Choose the right typeface according to your website personality:
4. When choosing font-sizes, limit choices!  Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range.
5. Use a font size between 16px & 32px for "Normal" text.
6. For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger.
7. For headlines, you can go really big (50px) and bold (600+), depending on personality.
8. For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular font weight).
9. Use less than 75 characters per line.
10. For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2.  For big text, go below 1.5.  (the smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height should be.)
11. If the headline looks unnatural, try decreasing the letter spacing in headlines.
12. Experiment with all caps for short titles.  Make them small and bold and increase letter-spacing.
13. Usually, don't justify text.
14. Don't center long text blocks.  Small blocks are fine.
