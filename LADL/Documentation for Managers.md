# Documentation for Managers

---

## Objectives :

- Describe the manager’s role and responsibility in documentation.
- Indicate at least three personnel matters that require manager documentation.

---

### Why Document?

As a manager, your goal in documentation is to record information that will provide evidence of action taken. Documentation provides a historical perspective that can be used to make important decisions, such as employee promotions or disciplinary actions.

Documentation serves as an aid to future managers and to the organization’s human resource (HR) professionals. Documentation ensures the following:

- Provides evidence that performance issues were discussed.
- Creates a chronological history of the employee’s performance.
- Provides evidence for company decisions such as salary increase, promotion, or termination.
- Provides evidence that protects the organization in the event of a lawsuit.

### Documentation Best Practices

- Identify company expectations. Clearly state the company policy related to the employee’s performance.
- Describe what needs to change.
- Include a detailed action plan with deadlines.
- Be specific and concise. This document is going into an employee’s personnel file. You want to avoid wordiness, opinions, and vague wording.
- Document in real time. It is difficult to remember conversations accurately. Create your document as you have the conversation with the employee or immediately after.

### Components of Documentation

It is not reasonable for a manager to expect that an employee’s actions will follow the expectation of the organization unless the expectations have been clearly communicated. Documentation provides a record that expectations have been communicated and reviewed.

Documentation of Mara’s meeting with Dave should include the following:

- The date that Mara met with Dave
- The dates of Dave’s incidences of lateness
- A brief statement about why consistently arriving late to work is not acceptable
- The desired outcome and a date of a follow-up review
- Signatures of Mara and Dave and the date the document was signed

Write all documentation as if it will be read by a third party. Documentation should include only the facts and not assumptions, conclusions, or judgments. The employee should be given a copy of the documentation and informed that a copy will be placed in their personnel file.

### What to Document 

For a manager, there is much more to be documented than misconduct. The following is a partial list of what needs to be documented; however, be aware that an organization can expand or reduce this list as needed:

- Attendance
- Performance management
- Corrective action
- Claim of harassment or discrimination
- Reports of workplace accident and injury and safety violations
