# Fall risks

---
## Objectives :
- Identify the most common risk factors that contribute to falls among older adults.
- List the appropriate steps to follow when a person suffers a fall.

---

Common risk factors:
- History of previous falls
- Fear & movement challenges
- Changes in gait
- Chronic conditions
- Vision & hearing loss
- Blood pressure
- Medications
- Environmental factors

STEADI three core elements:
1. Screening
2. Assessing
3. Implementing interventions for fall risk reduction

---

### Fall risk tests
In addition to screening tools, you can also assess a person for fall potential with tests such as:

##### 30-sec chair stand :
How many times within 30 seconds a person can stand from a seated position without using their hands for support
- Measures leg strength and endurance
- Low scores imply a fall risk.

##### Timed up and go (TUG) test :
Evaluates how long it takes a person to stand from a seated position and then walk 10 feet while moving at their regular stride.
- longer than 12-sec to finish this task, it raises their risk of falling.

##### 4-stage balance test :
Determines a person's capacity to hold four increasingly tough balancing postures for at least 10 seconds apiece.
- If unable to hold the last position for 10 seconds, their fall risk is greater.

##### Othostatic blood pressure test :
Attempts to recognize the presence of orthostatic hypotension, a type of blood pressure that suddenly drops as a person changes position from lying to sitting or sitting to standing.
- If positive, the person's risk for falling is greater.

##### Allen cognitive screen (Leather lacing tool) :
Stitch three progressively challenging stitches through pre-punched holes in a piece of leather.
- Evaluates risk via the Allen cognitive levels and modes of performance.

### Measures to implement a successful fall prevention program :

1. Implement an orientation process
2. Use exercise programs
3. Routine inspections of environment for fall risk factors
4. Exercise patience
5. Encourage the use of safety devices
6. Monitor people with risk of falls

### Actions after a fall :

Immediate Action:
1. Stay with person and ensure immediate safety.
2. Call for help and remain with the person until help arrives.

Other Actions:
- Alerting nursing staff
- Checking vitals
- Inspecting person for injuries
- Activate 911 system if required
- Starting basic life support if pulseless, unconscious, or breathless
- Asking bystanders about what happened
- Assist person to wheelchair or bed depending on RN's advice
- Maintaining cervical spine support if spine injury is suspected
- Investigate the fall: Immediate post-fall assessment & incident reporting.

Nursing and IDT (interdisciplinary team) should follow a post-fall algorithm to ask the following questions:
- Why and how?
- When and where?
- Staffing levels adequate?
- Were there environmental risk factors?
- What ar ethe person's contributing risk factors?
- Is there history of falls?
- Ar fall prevention interventions in place?
