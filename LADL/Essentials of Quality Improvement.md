# Quality Improvement

So, what **is** QI? The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, states that quality improvement, or QI, is the joining of two winning approaches to quality; Quality Assurance, or QA, and Performance Improvement, or PI, which together are referred to as QAPI. Healthcare staff use QA activities to meet quality standards with a goal of delivering those standards in the form of high quality care. QA is a reactive, retrospective effort to examine why a facility fell short meeting specified standards.

PI focuses on continuously testing and refining processes and performance to prevent failures of processes and achieve high quality standards. Sometimes, these two acronyms, PI and QI are used interchangeably. These are the actual methods used for continued study and improvement on work processes. QI, simply put, is taking a process, and making it better, safer, and more efficient. But that’s not all. When the processes we are about to discuss are embraced by staff, they build team unity and efficiency.

With the aim of improving the safety and quality of healthcare, the design of QI programs is based on fundamental traits that are (Jones et al., 2019):

- **Systematic**, meaning they have a structured and methodical approach.
- **Continuous**, meaning always looking to improve on processes.
- **Measurable**, which is based on acquired data that shows improvement, not one’s view that something has improved.

These terms define the essence of a QI program. QI is team-based and engages staff from all levels of the organization.

### Benefits of QI in Healthcare

Healthcare organizations focus on quality improvement when discussing how to improve the delivery of quality care and reduce costs (Hill, et al., 2020). There are many benefits that QI can have for an organization.

1. Improved Patient Outcomes
	- The main, and intended, benefit of QI is better outcomes for the population you serve. These outcomes will differ depending on your organization. 
2. Decreased Medical Costs
	 - Quality improvement can also help to decrease costs associated with failure and poor outcomes. Having processes that work cost less money.
3. Increased Efficiency
	- Employee efficiency is another benefit of a QI program. Effective systems and processes allow employees to do their job more efficiently.
4. Decreased Staff Turnover
	- Quality improvement programs also lead to happier employees. Happier employees are less likely to leave the organization.

#### Principles of a Successful QI Program

- Establishes a culture of quality.
- Supports a team approach and a hands-on work environment.
- Represents all disciplines and skill levels in team members.
- Defines quality.
- Prioritizes areas to improve.
- Uses the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) method.
- Collects and studies the data.
- Communicates the results.
- Commits to ongoing evaluation.
- Shares the lessons learned.

#### The PDSA Method

The PDSA four-stage method is a useful tool for conducting rapid improvements to processes. The PDSA method has become one of the most widely used tools for achieving improved processes and quality improvement in healthcare settings (Christoff, 2018).

**Stage 1: Plan**
- Identify the problem.
- Brainstorm and question the current state of processes:
    - What is being done now?
    - How is it being done?
    - What are the steps in place to do the task?
    - What people are involved in the process and what do they do?
    - Can the process be done better?

**Stage 2: Do**
- Put your plan into action.
- Test the proposed changes.
- Limit testing to smaller samples at first.

**Stage 3: Study**
- Review the results of your actions.
- Do you see trends?
- Can the process be improved upon?

**Stage 4: Act**
- Implement changes and standardize them.
- Return over the following months to check the ongoing results and ensure continued success.
- Share results and celebrate improvements and team success.
