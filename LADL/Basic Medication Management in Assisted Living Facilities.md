### The Medication Management Process

#### Your responsibilities :
- Assist w/ medications
- Gathering or pulling medications
- Passing medications
- Administering medication
- Following state regulations
- Knowing your organization's policies

#### Five Rights :

1. Right person
- Name
- Assigned ID number
- DoB
- Address or Room Number

2. Right drug
- "Three-check method":
	- When you take it from cabinet/drawer
	- When you get the medication out of the package
	- When you put the package back in the cabinet/drawer

3. Right dose
- e.g., If the dose calls for 100mg and each tablet contains 50mg, you would give 2 tablets.

4. Right time
- Common policy to allow 2hour window when passing medications (1 hour before/after)

5. Right route
- i.e., orally, topically, transdermal, etc...

6. Documentation
- Considered the "sixth" right. Always document that a medication was given.  If it was not given, document the reason it was not given.

#### Understanding Medication Orders :

- Routine: Set schedule
- PRN: As needed
- One-Time Order: Given once at a specified time
- STAT Order: Given ASAP
- Hold Order: Not given to patient for a period of time (e.g., days before an upcoming surgery)
- Discontinue Order (D/C Order): Medication is stopped and removed from medication storage area.

#### Controlled medication

- Medications that come with an abuse risk.  They might include pain medications or sedatives such as:
	- Morphine
	- Oxycodone
	- Tramadol
	- Diazepam
	- Pregabalin
	- Alprazolam
- Controlled medications are stored behind a secondary lock.
- Controlled medication count sheets are used to record every tie a medication is removed.
- Shift change requires counting of controlled medications.
	- Your replacement or supervisor will be witnesses to ensure med count is correct.

#### Medication Administration Safety and Best Practices

- One person at a time
- Get prepared
- Infection prevention
- Avoid Error
- Medication Timing
