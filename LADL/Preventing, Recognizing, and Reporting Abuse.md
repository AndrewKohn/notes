# Preventing, Recognizing, and Reporting Abuse

---

Abuse is the “willful infliction of injury, unreasonable confinement, intimidation, or punishment with resulting physical harm, pain or mental anguish” and includes depriving a person of the things they need to have physical, mental, and psycho-social well-being (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2017).  
To have a better understanding of abuse, you need to know about the different types of abuse. The five most common types are:
- Physical abuse
- Mental abuse
- Sexual abuse
- Financial abuse
- Neglect

Terms that help describe abuse:
- _Mistreatment_ is when a person is treated badly or _exploited_ by another person.    
- _Exploitation_ is when someone takes advantage of a person. It can happen through manipulation, intimidation, or threats.

#### Mental

**Mental abuse** is also called emotional or psychological abuse. It happens when someone uses words or actions to cause fear, shame, or distress in another person. Mental abuse can make a person feel unsafe.

Verbal abuse is a type of mental abuse. That’s when someone yells at or threatens another person.

Mental abuse can also happen when someone separates a person from others or from certain places against their will. This type of mental abuse is called _involuntary seclusion._

---
#### Physical

**Physical abuse** is using force to cause injury, pain, impairment, or death. It can involve:

- Hitting
- Slapping
- Pushing
- Shaking
- Using weapons

Physical abuse can also happen if you force someone to eat or if you use medications or restraints in the wrong way.

---
#### Sexual

**Sexual abuse** is non-consensual sexual contact, sexual harassment, or sexual contact by coercion.

_Non-consensual_ means against a person’s will. It can also mean the person cannot give consent due to age or problems with clear thinking.

_Coercion_ means a person is forced to perform sexual acts through physical force or verbal threats.

Sexual abuse includes inappropriate touching, forcing someone to look at pornography, and taking or sharing inappropriate photos of someone.

Keep in mind that sexual abuse can happen between two people who have a romantic relationship.

---
#### Financial

**Financial abuse** is taking something that belongs to someone else, including money, without the person’s consent. It can also be using someone’s property in an inappropriate way. You may have heard this called “misappropriation of property.”

---
#### Neglect

**Neglect** is when a caregiver deprives someone of something they need, such as:

- Medical care
- Shelter
- Food
- Water
- Hygiene
- Clothing

Neglect can also happen when a trusted caregiver does not help the person with their activities of daily living or protect them from harm.

Neglect can cause physical harm, pain, and emotional distress.

You may see the term “neglect” used as a separate form of abuse. **That’s because while other forms of abuse are always intentional (meaning done on purpose), neglect may be either intentional OR unintentional.**

#### Legal Responsibilities

Your employer has specific things that it must do when abuse is suspected or known.

Your organization must:
- Investigate all allegations of abuse.
- Document the results of any investigation.
- Protect the victim from further harm by removing the abusive person from care at once.

Your organization is required to report abuse. It may also need to report the results of its investigation to certain agencies. The agencies vary depending on the state and type of organization. For example, an assisted living facility may report alleged abuse to a different organization than a home health agency (CMS, 2020a). They may even have different deadlines for filing their reports.
