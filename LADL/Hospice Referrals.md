### Disease-Specific Eligibility
When a CMS-specified disease is present, individuals must meet functional and ADL dependence standards as well as the disease-specific standards.
Core criteria from the Medicare CGS:
1. Functional impairment is evidenced by KPS or PPS scores below 70%, below 40% for stroke and coma, and ≤ 50% for HIV disease.  For amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), KPS/PPS ≤ 50% is required if dyspnea does not qualify the individual w/ ALS.
2. Dependence for two or more of the following ADLs (feeding, amulation, continence, transfers, bathing, and dressing) supports eligibilty.

Advance care planning involves several steps:

2. Review goals for treatment with the surrogate.
3. Create and advance directive and/or POLST.
4. Update documents as needed for significant life events.
