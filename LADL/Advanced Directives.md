# Advanced Directives

---
## Objectives :
- Identify the most common types of advance directives and find out if a person has made them.
- Explain how advance directives can improve quality of life, even at the end of life.

---

Advanced directives are legal documents with instructions that apply if an adult is unable to make decisions about their own healthcare.

They are meant to ensure that a person's values related to dying, quality of life, and other relevant matters are honored.

***Informed Consent*** occurs when a healthcare provider educates the patient about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of a given procedure or intervention.  A person can only give informed consent if they understand their diagnosis.

The ***National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization*** website keeps an updated list of each state's advance directives and laws.

Some areas Advance Directive significant differences include:
- How much information a patient should be given about their condition.
- How long to continue life-sustaining treatment
- Whether decisions are made by the person or their family.
- A person's degree of trust in the system of care.

### Patient Self-Determination Act, or PSDA

- The PSDA requires hospitals and care facilities to ask patients about advance directives **at the time of admission** and provide information about their rights.

### Common types of Advance Directives

#### Living Wills :
- Contain instructions about how a person wants to be cared for in the event that they have a condition that is likely to be life-ending or are in a state of unconsciousness from which they are unlikely to recover.
- The focus of a living will is on treatments that are used to prolong and sustain life, such as:
	- CPR
	- Ventilators
	- Tube Feeding
	- Dialysis
- It must have been signed when the person was able to understand both its contents and how the advance directive could be used.
- A person may cancel or change a living will at any time, as long as they are able to understand what they are doing.
- Elements that may differ from state-to-state include:
	- Number of witnesses
	- Who can be a witness
	- Notarization
	- Electronic records
	- Regular renewal

#### Durable Power of Attorney for Healthcare (DPOA) :
- A healthcare agent is usually able to access all medical records, consent or refuse medical treatments, and select or discharge a healthcare provider.
- DPOA applies anytime an individual is incapable of making healthcare decisions for themselves, not just near the end of their life.
- An agent may be called upon to make decisions while a person is *temporarily* incapacitated, but likely to recover.

Legal Guardianship
- An individual makes the decision on the POA, but the court makes the decision about who their legal guardian is.
- Usually considered when there is no reasonable alternatives.

A legal guardian is appointed when:
- An adult is no longer able to make sound decisions for themselves appropriately.
- A child has no parent to care for them and no adult with legal custody.

#### DNR Orders :
- Is a written instruction stating that person should NOT be given CPR if their heart stops or they stop breathing.
- Unless emergency personnel who arrive on the scen can find and quickly determine that a DNR is valid, they will perform CPR despite the person's wishs.

#### National POLST :
- Is for patients who have seriosuly life-limiting illnesses.  These spell out specific treatments a patient should receive in an emergency or medical crisis.
A POLST differs from an Advance Directive in several ways:
- It is only intended for people with a limited life expectancy.
- It is a highly visible, portable document that is kept with the individual at all times.
- It is 'fully actionable', followed by all emergency personnel that come into contact with the individual.
- It can be used to guide the care of a minor.

#### Organ Donation Directives :
- These preferences are usually indicated on state id or licenses, but can be addressed in a more general Advance Directive.

#### Psychiatric Advance Directives :
- Psychiatric Advance Directives document an individual's treatment preferences in the event that a chronic mental illness impairs their mental competency.
- These instructions may be stand-alone documents or part of a broader healthcare advance directive.  In some cases, they may authorize an agent to make decisions on their behalf regarding their psychiatric care.
