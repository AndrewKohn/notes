# Infection Control and Prevention

---
## Objectives :
- Describe how infectious agents are transmitted and the chain of infection.
- Identify at least three ways to break the chain of infection.
- Explain additional incfection control considerations.

---

### Chain of Infection
- Infectious Agent: virus, bacterium, microorganism, etc... 
- Reservoir: Where the IA can live, grow, and multiply.
- Portal of Exit: Where the IA can exit the resevoir (e.g., coughing)
- Portal of Entry: IA enters the body of the new host.
- Method of Transmission: Travel from resevior to a new host.
- Susceptible Host: Person at risk of getting an infection.

--- 

### How Infection Spreads :
- Contact Transmission (direct, indirect)
- Droplet Transmission (e.g., coughing, sneezing)
- Airborne Transmission 
- Vehicle Transmission (food, water, aerosols)
- Vector Transmission (mosquitos, fleas, ticks)

Risk Factors For Infection
- skin integrity (cuts, wounds, surgical incisions)
- Medical devices (catheters, feeding tubes, IV lines)
- Body's immune system

### Breaking the Chain of Infection

1. Standard precautions regardless of whether you suspect or know the person has an infection.

Standard precautions must be used everytime you think you may encounter:
- Blood
- Bodily Fluids
- Secretions
- Exretions, except sweat
- Non-intact Skin
- Mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, and eyes

2. Proper hand hygeine and PPE.
3. Proper use of sharps (needles, razors, lancets, etc...)
4. Environmental considerations
