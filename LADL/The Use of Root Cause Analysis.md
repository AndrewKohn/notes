# The Use of Root Cause Analysis

---

## Objectives :

- Describe how a root cause analysis can be used proactively and reactively.

---

The goal of a root cause analysis is to find out why something happened so that it can be prevented.  A root cause is defined as an error that, if corrected or avoided, will prevent the event from happening again.

---
#### Reactive :
A reactive root cause analysis typically takes place after an adverse event has occurred.

#### Proactive :
Is a tool to predict problems before they occur.  Putting process improvement changes into effect proactively can decrease the risk of an adverse event happening in the first place.

---
#### Best Practices :
- Using an interdisciplinary team for a more complete process.
- Basing all statements on facts rather than assumptions.
- Listing the causes of the problem, not the symptoms.
- Focusing on long-term success rather than a quick fix.
- Documenting the process so that you may revisit it if needed.

---
### Approaches :

A simple approach to a root cause analysis is called the "Five Whys".  After defining a problem, the team repeatedly asks the questions "Why?" until they are led to a root cause of the problem.
