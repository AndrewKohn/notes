| Feedback:                                                                  | Actually, giving people with disabilities equal access to benefits in the workplace is a requirement of the Americans with Disabilities Act, not requiring any accommodation needed for the person to do the job. The Americans with Disabilities Act protects the rights of people with disabilities by eliminating barriers to their participation in many aspects of living and working in the U.S. In spite of these protections, significant challenges still exist. |
