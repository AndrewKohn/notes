# Aging and Sexuality - For LTC Healthcare Professionals

---

## Objectives :

- Differentiate between normal age-related sexual changes and changes caused by disease and disability.
- Identify the necessary steps to take in recognizing and addressing the sexual needs of people who live in long-term care settings.
- Recognize stereotypical age-biased views of sexuality among older adults.
- Apply the ethical concepts of autonomy and dignity to sexual issues in long-term care settings.

### Focus on Risk Management

The challenges presented in a LTCF setting might appear to minimize the importance and even the discussion of sexuality. Long-term care staff members often are overworked and underpaid. Administrators have serious legal risks and financial problems that demand their attention.

Much of the attention in LTCFs is focused on risk management, such as reducing falls, preventing pressure injuries and health complications caused by neglect or poor care, preventing wandering and other difficult behaviors, and managing family threats to sue. Efforts are focused on providing the best possible healthcare at the lowest cost, providing some level of activity, and offering therapeutic interventions. With these demands, it is not surprising that the sexual needs of individuals in LTCFs receive little attention.

However, LTCFs and long-term care professionals can take the following steps to recognize and address these needs:

- Recognize that older persons might be interested in sex.
- Recognize that even those with physical disabilities and dysfunction still have sexual feelings and desires.
- Treat sexual feelings and activities as normal, not dirty or inappropriate.
- Treat sexual or romantic behavior as normal, not "cute." The elderly should not be made fun of or made the focus of special attention because of romantic involvement.
- Provide privacy for someone who desires sexual activity whether the activity is masturbation or sexual activity with another individual.
- Incorporate issues of sexual health and wellness into each person’s physical assessment.

Have a policy in place to determine when sexual behavior is appropriate between people with dementia. Criteria may include the following:

- Both must understand the relationship.
- Both should be able to avoid being exploited.
- Both are aware of the risks.

Counsel the person’s spouse or partner that they have a right to have sex or not to have sex with their partner. Also, the spouse or partner should never tolerate abuse or participate in any activity they do not want.

Educate staff, individuals you serve, and families about the normalcy of sexual activity and policies on providing privacy. Training also should include how to identify the signs of sexual abuse and protect all parties from abuse and exploitation.

Provide education and counseling to individuals regarding the causes and prevention of STIs and HIV/AIDS.

### Managing the Expression of Sexuality

Dementia-related inappropriate sexual behaviors are common in the long-term care setting. Recent research has focused on early identification and prevention of inappropriate sexual behaviors (Srinivasan et al., 2019). It also presents tactics for management with or without pharmacologic interventions.

Managing the sexual expression of older adults in long-term care settings creates specific challenges for caregiving staff. To date, there has been scant guidance for caregivers seeking to follow a person-center approach to this dilemma (Syme et al., 2016). Updated policies and procedures are required on this subject and should address the nuances across the entire long-term care continuum.

A qualitative design study published in 2016 in the _Journal of Advanced Nursing_ gave recommendations across eight categories that corresponded to key changes identified by long-term care directors of nursing (DONs) challenged by the increasing sexual expression of older adults in their respective facilities (Syme et al., 2016). DONs provided valuable input throughout this study. Categories identified for consideration include:

1.  Category 1:  Address the issue
DONs have expressed the need for their local facilities and national organizations, such as CMS, to demonstrate increased attention to and understanding of the sexual expression and consent in the older adults in their care. Complicating factors of stigma and the perception that sex is ignored in LTCF settings creates effects to consider. Several DONs suggested that all entities serving the long-term care community must examine their current mindset toward the sexuality of their older adult population.

2. Category 2:  Make environmental changes
Numerous challenges associated with LTCF environments, such as time, staffing, and privacy, were identified in the study. These findings led DONs to recommend the following changes to facilitate the ease of the older adult’s sexual expression:

- Knock-first policy
- Do not disturb signs
- Wider beds or joining beds
- Improved policies and procedures

3.  Category 3:  Identify staff with expertise
Identifying expertise across different disciplines and ensuring their active engagement on interdisciplinary teams and that their voices are heard is vital. DONs suggested the use of ombudsmen, family engagement, and the appropriate behavioral health staff would add significant value when sexuality and consent issues arise.

4. Category 4:  Provide education & training
This category was prevailing amongst the recommendations. All DONs supported the importance of continuing education on older adult sexuality. They held that improved education had a direct positive correlation to the challenges related to:

- Negative attitudes from staff and family toward sexual expression
- General lack of knowledge about sexual expression

The study revealed a priority of increasing staff awareness of their individual attitudes toward sexuality and the continued need for expert referrals to keep abreast of current viewpoints on older adult sexuality and consent across the long-term care continuum.

5. Category 5: Assess sexuality initially and recurrently
Many DONs endorsed enacting processes for evaluating the sexuality of older adults in the long-term care continuum. They suggested this be done at admission and routinely thereafter to effectively monitor the sexual needs and behaviors of these adults. Emphasis also should be placed on supporting the older adults’ sexual needs and educating the family to identify any knowledge barriers. Beginning these discussions during the admission period is vital.

6. Category 6: Establish policies/procedures for sexual expression management
The study authors uncovered a general lack of policies and procedures that specifically address how staff can best manage the sexual needs and behaviors of older adults in LTCFs. It also highlighted the need to address “consent,” which is many times called into question and creates dilemmas.

The study authors concluded that the federal and state agencies that regulate the care of older adults in LTCFs lacks meaningful guidance on managing sexual behavior and onset. Addressing the sexual needs of older adults in LTCFs should be proactive and driven by sound policy and associated staff training. Policies and training should effectively guide the management of sexual expression and consent by older adults in the long-term care continuum, including:

- Recommending elements of policy to deal with sexual expression
- Delivering educational resources
- Adapting for managing older adults’ sexual situations
- Providing direction for family involvement
- Integrating care into routine planning and documentation
- Implementing detailed guidelines to evaluate sexual consent

7. Category 7: Develop assessment tools for sexual expression & consent
Many of the DONs in the study asserted that currently, the tools and assessments used for assessing older adults’ sexual behavior and consent are inadequate. This causes extreme difficulty for caregiving staff when trying to manage complex situations related to sexual encounters and consents in the long-term care setting. The foremost recommendation that came out of the study concluded that the adoption of a structured approach and tools be created to manage sexual behaviors and consent in the population. These modalities must be easy to use, quickly available, and have the associated staff training to support correct use. Study participants were quick to mention that a “one-size-fits-all” approach should be replaced with a structured approach that considers the individualistic nature of each occurrence.

8. Category 8:  Clarify legal issues
Legal issues were underscored during the discussions. Each DON referenced the importance of understanding and considering the legal implications when dealing with sexual behavior and consent in their facilities. It was expressed that legal issues arise during the management of sexual behaviors and the interpretation of consent adequacy. Many felt that facility and familial restrictions placed on the sexual expression of the older adults directly correlated to any legal issues that arose. When contemplating legal encounters, DONs also suggested the use of ombudsmen for advocacy and supplementary backup to fortify the evidence of their determination to permit or not permit the intimate activity.
