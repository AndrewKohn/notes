### Manager Versus Leader

- Process vs Vision:  Leading teams through change requires a vision. Managers make sure goals are communicated and implemented. A leader focuses on a vision and drives change.
- Organizing vs Aligning:  A manager works to achieve a goal through strategic planning and coordinated actions. For example, they may come up with a communication plan. Leaders focus less on coordinating people to perform tasks. Instead, they align themselves with their team to influence them.
- Position vs Quality:  A manager is a specific role within an organization with set responsibilities. A leader has qualities that influence others, no matter their title or position. Being a manager does not make someone a leader.

### Tips on How to Be an Effective Leader

- Share the vision
- Lead by example
- Put people first
- Make decision
- Welcome failure

You can develop critical communication skills as a leader. The following are some of the most important communication skills (Hawaii Pacific University, 2021):

- Active listening
- Compassion
- Empathy

****Active listening**** involves paying attention both verbally and nonverbally to another person. You must develop this skill so that you can motivate others. It also helps avoid breakdowns in communication.

Active listening includes culturally appropriate cues and affirmations that show you are paying attention. For example, you should:

- Listen to understand instead of respond.
- Maintain eye contact with the speaker without staring.
- Face the speaker directly with a relaxed posture.
- Nod at times to show attention.
- Repeat what the person has just said to confirm what you have heard.
- Use open-ended questions to learn more about a person's feelings or concerns.

**Empathy** is the ability to understand another person's:

- Point of view
- Feelings
- Motivations

Empathy helps create a safe setting for open dialogue between two people. Leaders who show empathy to their staff are more likely to find the cause of an issue. This leads to higher accuracy, greater effectiveness, and closer relationships. 

Here's how you can show empathy as a leader:

- Pay attention to what your staff members have to say.
- Get to know your staff on a personal level.
- Be open to different viewpoints.
- Train to gain additional experience and skills.

Empathy is a positive and necessary skill for people to be more productive.

**Compassion** is having good intentions and being concerned about others. It involves showing kindness while maintaining some emotional distance.

People are more likely to form bonds with compassionate leaders. Behaviors that show compassion are thoughtful. Even the smallest kindness can have far-reaching effects.

Leaders who demonstrate compassion (Hougaard et al., 2020):

- Improve collaboration
- Increase trust
- Enhance loyalty

As a leader, you can apply compassion in the following ways:

- Take care of yourself by getting enough rest, taking breaks, and stopping self-criticism.
- Take the time to think of someone's point of view before meeting them.
- Practice compassion daily for it to grow stronger and more evident.
- Be direct and honest if staff underperform.
- Make it a habit to have at least one direct, assertive encounter per day.
- Practice mindfulness daily to enhance leadership skills.

### Organizational Alignment

An organization's performance is based on its:

- Mission
- Vision
- Goals

An engaged workforce that embraces a shared vision, mission, and goals creates organizational alignment.

Here is an easy way to apply organizational alignment:

Match the staff to the job:
- No one wants the right person to be in the wrong job. Consider asking your staff:
    - What are their motivations?
    - What are their three-year goals?
    - What will they do if their goals aren't met?
- An open dialog now can prevent talent loss later.

Identify staff roles within the team:
- Groups and teams need clear roles and responsibilities. People are harder to hold accountable if you don't know what they do.
- When team roles are clear, power struggles and "that's not my job" responses are avoided.

Align the team with others:
- Organizations can only succeed if their teams are aligned. Team alignment is impeded by poor communication due to:
    - A lack of transparency 
    - Unclear goals 
    - A skewed outlook
- It takes work to align teams. Conversations also take time, courage, and openness.
- Organizational alignment starts with good communication. The first step to aligning teams is to figure out how each team:
    - Defines success
    - Measures success
    - Communicates

**More Benefits** 

Apart from their pay, other benefits motivate staff:

- Health insurance
- Profit-sharing
- Flexible schedules
- Recognition

Also, staff members want wellness programs such as:

- Cafeterias or food access
- On-site fitness centers
- Health coaching services

**Get Feedback and Take Action**

It is important for organizations to ask staff members about what needs change or improvement. This can be accomplished using different methods such as employee surveys and focus groups.

### Discretionary Effort

Effective leadership is about getting the most out of staff. However, one must adopt a proactive mindset to be an effective leader.

A proactive mindset can help staff:

- Have new ideas
- Be creative
- Take initiative
- Get excited

People have basic psychological needs to feel successful and happy at work and home. In all areas of life, six core needs are vital to psychological well-being (Jeffries, 2018). The six basic needs driving human behavior are:

- Certainty: To know that something will be pleasant and avoid pain
- Variety: To try and experience new things
- Significance: To feel needed, important, or unique
- Connection: To feel close to someone or something
- Growth: To be able to learn, grow, and become better
- Impact: To give, be helpful, and support others

**Discretionary effort** is when someone voluntarily goes beyond their normal duties (Hardy et al., 2020). People who feel validated by their leader will self-regulate and sacrifice. Engaged followers will encourage others to adopt the cause. They follow because they support the leader as a person. 

Discretionary effort comes in different forms. It most often refers to time, intensity, or direction. Staff who have discretionary effort are willing to:

- Work longer hours
- Complete their usual tasks faster or harder
- Perform tasks outside of their role

**Build a Culture of Trust**

Think about the values and mission of your organization. Use it to create an open and trusting culture.

As a leader, communicate your vision clearly and demonstrate its value. It gives staff purpose, focuses, and makes them more productive. It also shows them you value their work. The more valued you make your staff feel, the more likely they are to make discretionary efforts.

**Motivate Staff**

In the modern workplace, staff members want to feel a sense of purpose. But over time, long-term staff may lose sight of why their work is important.

Instead of telling your team members why they matter, show them why. Let them know the results of their efforts. When staff members see the impact of their work, they will stay motivated.

**Be Aware of Their Work-life Balance**

Work-life balance is crucial to your team's dedication. In today's culture, some companies praise staff members who:

- Work long hours.
- Are always available.
- Let big projects take over their personal time.

Encourage them to take a break if they appear:

- Stressed
- Burnt out
- To be losing focus

It pays off to have devoted, happy, and productive team members.

### Staff Retention

The _**staff turnover rate**_ can reveal much about work culture and other metrics. The turnover rate is the number of staff members who leave in one year. It usually applies to an entire company. It can also apply to a department or team.

There are two types of staff turnover: Voluntary and involuntary. _**Voluntary turnover**_ is when staff members decide to leave. _**Involuntary turnover**_ is when an employer terminates a staff member.

**Toxic Workplace Culture**

The main cause of high turnover is a toxic work culture (Nolan, 2022). A toxic work environment is more of a feeling than a checklist. But toxic workplaces share a few traits.

A toxic workplace tolerates: 

- Showing disrespect
- Abusive behavior
- Leaving others out
- Unethical decision making
- Being selfish 
- Being average

**A Lack of Leadership Communication**

Every day, staff interact with different types of people. Everyone has their own style of communication at work. Keeping communication open is key to company success.

 Leaders who lack communication can cause staff to feel ignorant and confused. As a result, they may:

- Fill in the blanks
- Feel cut off
- Lose motivation

**Lack of Recognition**

Recognition is a core part of workplace culture. It is important for staff members to feel that their work matters. They also want to feel noticed and valued.

Many people face hardships at work. Hardships deserve more than just a paycheck. Staff members want to be recognized for their hard work.

**Lack of Career Growth and Development**

Growth is a natural goal. Both income and professional growth are important to staff members.

Talented people want to grow and develop. Staff members will leave if there is no growth or their work does not align with their talents.

**Lack of Flexibility and Work-Life Balance**

Overtime is common among staff. When they are asked to work longer hours too often, they feel overworked and stressed. 

Many staff members want flexibility. They need to be able to juggle outside duties well. A lack of flexibility makes it hard to balance life stressors. As a result, the worker seeks employment elsewhere.

**A Lack of Feedback**

Staff may leave if communication channels are not open and transparent. Staff members need feedback so they can manage their workload and refocus. They will feel frustrated without feedback or recognition.

**A Negative View of Leadership**

Staff members who lack trust and view leadership negatively may leave. When staff members are overmanaged, they can feel controlled. It may feel like they need more freedom to do their job.
#### Key Retention Interventions

- Improve Onboarding
- Support Learning and Training
- Support a Nice Work Environment
- Focus on Clear Communication

- Make sure there is constant, two-way communication.
- Give clear details to your staff.
- Refer to policies when discussing a new task.

#### Gap Analysis

A **gap analysis** identifies ways an organization can improve performance. During a gap analysis, three questions are asked:

- How is the company doing right now?
- What is the goal we are aiming for?
- What is needed to reach that goal?

There are two broad categories of gap analysis: Strategic and operational.

A **strategic gap analysis** compares ideal and real outcomes. It identifies what steps leaders must take to reduce the gaps.

For example, a home health agency wants to improve performance by comparing its value-based purchasing, or VBP, scores. The agency wants to compare its performance with other agencies across the U.S. It also wants to compare its performance to a previous baseline. In this case, the agency would need to conduct a strategic gap analysis.

An **operational gap analysis** looks at a specific project or process. An operational gap analysis can help find out what's missing from systems already in place.

For example, a company determines that staff engagement is at an all-time low. Their goal is to review current processes and determine what needs to be improved. An operational gap analysis would help them understand this issue better.

**SWOT Analysis**

When performing a gap analysis, SWOT is commonly used (Schooley, 2022). SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Each of these four areas is considered in a SWOT analysis to develop an action plan. 

A SWOT analysis should be done anytime before you: 

- Take any kind of action for the company.
- Take on new projects.
- Update internal policies.
- Change or modify a plan during its execution.

In a SWOT analysis, each element is compared side by side in four columns. The sections with strengths, “S,” and weaknesses, “W,” refer to internal factors within a company. You may be able to pull from the following resources:

- Financial: Funding, source of income, or investor
- Physical: Location, facilities, and equipment
- Human resources: Staff, volunteers, and customers
- Current processes: Training, departments, and software

External factors influence every company, organization, and person. No matter the connection between an opportunity, “O,” and a threat, “T,” it is important to note and document them. External factors are things you cannot control, like:

- Trends in the market: New products, advances in technology, and changes in client needs
- Trends in the economy: Financial trends on a local, national, and global scale
- Funding: Government, insurance, and other sources
- Demographics: Gender, age, education level, religion, etc.
- Relationships: Suppliers, partners, and referral sources
- Regulations: Political, environmental, and economic
