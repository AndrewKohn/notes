# Basics of Tuberculosis

---

TB is either a latent TB infection or an active TB disease. Latent TB infection means a person has been around the bacteria but has no symptoms. This phase of TB can last for years until it becomes active.

Active TB disease happens when a person has been around TB and then gets sick. Symptoms occur when the bacteria grow in number. Some people with latent TB infection may never develop active TB disease, while others do.

- TB is a bacterial infection that can affect different parts of the body, primarily the lungs.
- TB can exist as a latent TB infection or active TB disease.
- TB can be spread through tiny droplets carrying bacteria.
- People with weakened immune systems or those who spend time around people with active TB are at higher risk of catching the disease.
- TB prevention interventions include lifestyle changes at individual, family, and community levels.
- Environmental factors play a crucial role in the transmission of TB.
- Regular screenings for TB are required to determine who is at high risk.
- TB is curable and treatment regimens should focus on creating the shortest possible regimen to minimize side effects and improve medication compliance.

TB can infect many areas of the body, including the:
- Kidneys
- Liver
- Spinal fluid
- Heart
- Genitals
- Lymph nodes
- Bones and joints
- Skin
- Blood vessels
- Throat

When TB bacterium multiply in the body, a person develops symptoms. Symptoms of active TB disease include (CDC, 2023a):
- A cough lasting more than 3 weeks
- Coughing up blood
- Pain in the chest with breathing or coughing
- Feeling weak
- Tiredness
- Losing weight
- Fever and chills
- Sweating during the night
- A poor appetite

At the beginning of employment, healthcare workers typically go through TB screening to detect the potential introduction of TB into the workplace. This helps prevent the spread of active TB infections.

The CDC (2023c) also recommends the use of airborne infection isolation rooms, or AIIRs, for any person with suspected or confirmed active TB. These used to be called negative pressure isolation rooms.

### How Tuberculosis Is Spread

TB spreads through tiny droplets that hold bacteria and are released when a person coughs, sneezes, or talks (CDC, 2022). The bacteria then enter another person's lungs when they breathe in. TB particles can remain in the air for several hours, based on the environment. People with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are more prone to catching TB (Mayo Clinic, 2023).

Spending time with someone who has active TB disease puts you at a higher risk of catching the disease. You cannot catch TB by touching surfaces, touching a person, or handling dirty clothes. However, the bacteria that cause TB can live outside of the body for a few hours and sometimes even months under certain conditions.

### Testing for Tuberculosis

There are two ways someone can be tested for TB: A skin test or a blood test. The skin test, called the Mantoux tuberculin skin test, is the most common method to test for TB.


#### TB Skin Test
A TB skin test, or Mantoux, requires a small amount of tuberculin to be injected under the skin. The site is assessed for a reaction after 48 to 72 hours. A negative test result means no TB infection. A positive result requires further testing, such as a chest X-ray and sputum sample, to determine if TB is latent or active. Some redness at the injection site is normal and should not cause panic.

Anyone who works for a healthcare organization with direct access to patients, residents, or clients is required by state regulations to be tested for TB. You should be familiar with your organization’s policies on TB testing. Your organization may require a 1-step or a 2-step skin test based on your role.

#### TB Blood Test
Two types of blood tests are also currently available in the U.S. (CDC, 2023b). These tests include:

- QuantiFERON® - TB Gold Plus or QFT-Plus
- T-SPOT® TB test or T-Spot

A TB blood test is recommended for those who have received the TB vaccine. It is also recommended for anyone having difficulty returning for the second visit to have their skin test read (CDC, 2023b). As with the TB skin tests, a negative blood test means the person is not likely to have latent TB or TB disease. A positive blood test means the person is infected with TB.

Both the skin and blood tests cannot distinguish between an active TB disease or latent TB infection (CDC, 2023b). A healthcare provider orders more tests, such as a chest X-ray and medical examination, to make a final diagnosis.

### Treatment Interventions

If properly followed, current treatment programs can cure TB. They can also prevent the development of active TB later in life. A major challenge with TB treatment is to create the shortest possible regimen to minimize side effects and improve medication compliance. If active TB disease is not treated, it can lead to death.

#### Latent TB

Treatment for latent TB infection consists of taking a single medication or a combination of medications. Depending on what is prescribed, these medications will be taken for 3 to 9 months. Short-term treatment of latent TB for 3 to 4 months is recommended for improved compliance (CDC, 2020).

#### Active TB

Treatment for active TB disease usually consists of a combination of different medications for 4 to 9 months. The CDC recommends the shortest medication regimen possible to improve compliance.
