# Basics of Hand Hygiene

---

Hand hygiene is a general term that describes hand washing using soap and water **OR** the use of an alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) to destroy harmful pathogens.

Employer's policies may differ, but you should lather soap over all surfaces of the hands for **AT LEAST** 20 seconds.

You may use ABHR unless hand washing w/ soap is required.  You **cannot use** ABHRs if working in a food service setting.
