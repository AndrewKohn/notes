## Workplace Violence

### Definition
A verbal or physical act that occurs against a person **while at work** or in their **occupational setting**.  Workplace violence is **any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threats of disruptive behavior that occur at the worksite**.

Workplace violence is **not limited** to cases that occur on employer premises.  It also includes **off-site business-related functions**.

### Health Status
A person that is **saying their goodbyes** and/or **giving away belongings** can be a sign of suicidal intent or an indication of a person of interest that may perform harmful actions to themselves or others.

## Prevention & Survival
---
### Work Environment
You can create a safer, more enjoyable workplace by maintaining positive relations, dealing with disagreements early, and recognizing employees who may be having trouble.

Good ways to build a **strong workplace** culture include:
- Having a clear and open discussion in the organization.
- Providing chances for professional development.
- Promoting a family-friendly environment.
- Encourage transparency for complaints and concerns.
- Demonstrating impartial and consistent disciplinary measures.
- Fostering a focus on the quality of life and job satisfaction.
- Providing timely feedback.

### Warning Signs
Changes in the **patterns of conduct** may also be an early sign of potential problems ahead.

Behavior indicators to watch out for:
- Adverse changes in attendance
- Supervisory coaching
- Work productivity
- Work consistency
- Concentration & focus
- Past performance

### De-Escalation Techniques
- Active Listening
- Provide Options
- Remove the Audience
- Set Clear Boundaries
- Avoid Physical Contact

### Surviving an Encounter
- Keeping a distance at least 6-8 ft from the aggressor.
- Use barriers to keep individuals from coming close to you.
- Do not turn your back on them.
- Being aware of any objects in and around the workplace that are easily accessible and can be used as a weapon.
- Avoid attempts that prevent them from leaving or entering the workplace.
- Avoid physical contact if possible.  Physical or chemical restraint methods **may be required**. 

## Reporting Violence
---
The warning signs of potentially **violent behaviors** provide a more significant opportunity for **early intervention**.

If you fear a direct threat, call 911 ASAP.  Next notify leadership.

- Preserve & submit any evidence which may include damaged property or written threat.
- Obtain contact information of any witnesses involved.
- Prepare the report as objectively as possible.  Telling what behaviors you observed and other facts.

Privacy policies **ban supervisors** from **sharing what steps they are taking behind the scenes**, which can give the impression that nothing is being done.

Management should **assure staff that actions are being taken**, even though they cannot be shared openly.

### Barriers of Reporting
Can be someone that knew something **before** the event and **did not** let others know.

Barriers that may prevent timely reporting include:
- Being afraid that you are over-blowing the issue.
- Not wanting to get anyone in trouble.
- Fear of retaliation.
- Not thinking anything will be done.
